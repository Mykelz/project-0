  <h2><span>About Me</span></h2>

  <p>Hey! I am <strong>Mykelz.</strong> coding has chanegd my world. Its not just about apps, Learning to code gave me problem solving skills and a way to communicate with others  on a technical level. I am currently pursuing  a first degree in Industrial Mathematics in the great University of Benin. I am very enthusiastic about coding and i realised that there is an underlying connection between Mathematics and coding. This is my first proffessional coding project and i am very excited and eager to work and learn more on this beautiful and rewarding journey.</p>
